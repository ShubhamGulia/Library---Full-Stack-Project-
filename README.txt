Hi, WELCOME friend

TO run the project install My SQL server on the desktop or You can even use SQL server provided by the institution. 

The front end has been scripted in PHP, CSS and backend in SQL(Structured query language)

Step to follow:-
1. Move the Front end folder files to the localhost directory. 
2. Import the backend folder-libraryfinal.sql file to the My SQL server. 
3. Go to the browser, type localhost and you will see the index page loading up.
